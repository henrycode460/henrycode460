Hello, Iâ€™m Henry V. Singbeh Full-stack developer, and a computer system engineer who has been opportune to work in the information and technology industry for the past four years. I served as an IT Technician working in a very stressful and intensive team working environment. I also did an internship at IPMC Ghana from June 2020 to July 2021 as a frontend developer; working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and WordPress, where I was required to apply effective and efficient time management abilities. 

I am currently studying HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, REACT JS, RUBY, RAIL, AND SQL Database as an international remote developer at Microverse, a remote software development program that uses pair programming and project building to teach development. After my study, I will look forward to getting hired by employers who need international remote developers in any of those technologies mentioned above.
