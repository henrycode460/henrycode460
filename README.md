Hello, I’m Henry V. Singbeh Full-stack developer, and a computer system engineer who have been opportune to work in the information and technology industry for the past four years where I served as an IT Technician under a very stressful and intensive team working environment that gives me the abilities to work under pressure and as a great team member. 

Currently, technologies that I have covered and have control over are but not limited to: System Analysis and Design (Software Development), Programming Methods, HTML & CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and C++. Through my problem solving ability and my level of understanding as it relates to what I have been taught – I have been able to develop or create a working application for each of the technologies mentioned above. 

I have heard about your company when attending a Full Stack developer conference hosted in Dubai; most of the speaker's reference your institution as the number one hiring institution who hired based on merit. And I also experienced the uniqueness of your products and I definitely came to the conclusion that you are “First among Equal”. 

I will appreciate it if you can grant me a 20 minutes zoom meeting at your convenient time to discuss more on your career trajectory.
